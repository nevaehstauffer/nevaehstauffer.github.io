    "section": "",
    "text": "For the last five seasons, only 1 of 5 have ended with a winning record and that was back in the 2018-2019 season. For the next four seasons, the best record they have had was when they went 16-16 last season. It seems Nebraska’s men’s basketball team shoots way better when they play at home compared to when they’re away. Is it their home atmosphere or just the familiarity of PBA? Let’s see if numbers can back up this idea.\nSports Reference is a sports statistics website that provides the shooting percentages over each of the last five seasons. You can see the percentages of overall shots, free throws, and three-pointers. Within the data, it is easy to calculate Nebraska and the rest of college basketball’s shooting averages while differentiating the home and away games. To determine whether there is a clear answer about where the Husker’s shoot best, let’s look at Nebraska’s home and away shooting percentages from the last 5 seasons.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nmen2019 &lt;-read_csv(\"neb.2019.csv\")\nmen2020 &lt;-read_csv(\"neb.2020.csv\")\nmen2021 &lt;-read_csv(\"neb.2021.csv\")\nmen2022 &lt;-read_csv(\"neb.2022.csv\")\nmen2023 &lt;-read_csv(\"neb.2023.csv\")\n\nmen &lt;- bind_rows(men2019,men2020,men2021, men2022, men2023)\n\nmenthrees &lt;- men |&gt; \n  group_by(Location, Year) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    Average3PPct = mean(ThreePpct)\n  )\nmentwos &lt;- men |&gt; \n  group_by(Location, Year) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    AverageFGpct = mean(FGpct)\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data = menthrees, aes(x = Year, y = Average3PPct, color = Location, group=Location)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Nebraska shoots better with the home court advantage\",\n    subtitle = \"1 out of the 5 last seasons their 3P% on the road is worse\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Averages\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | Nevaeh Stauffer\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(color = \"red\", size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 12, face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska has shot significantly better on their home court behind the three point line for 4 out of the 5 past seasons. During the 2021-2022 season the away percentage was better but not by much.\nNow let’s compare the same data about Nebraska’s last five seasons to the rest of the teams in the Big 10 and see where they stand.\n\n\nCode\nlogs23 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/logs23.csv\")\nlogs22 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/logs22.csv\")\nlogs21 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/logs21.csv\") \nlogs20 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/logs20.csv\") |&gt; \n  rename(Season = season, TeamFull=Team)\nlogs19 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/logs19.csv\") |&gt; \n  rename(Season = season, TeamFull=Team)\n\nlogs &lt;- bind_rows(logs23, logs22, logs21, logs20, logs19) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Location = case_when(\n      is.na(HomeAway) == TRUE ~ \"Home\",\n      HomeAway == \"@\" ~ \"Away\",\n      HomeAway == \"N\" ~ \"Neutral\"\n    )\n  )\n\nhomeawaylogs &lt;- logs |&gt; \n  group_by(TeamFull, Conference, Season, Location) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    Average3PPct = mean(Team3PPCT, na.rm=TRUE)\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(TeamLocation = paste(TeamFull, Location))\n\nbig10away &lt;- homeawaylogs |&gt;\n  filter(str_trim(Conference) == \"Big Ten\") |&gt; \n  filter(Location == \"Away\")\n\n\nbig10home &lt;- homeawaylogs |&gt;\n  filter(str_trim(Conference) == \"Big Ten\") |&gt; \n  filter(Location == \"Home\")\n\nnuhome &lt;- big10home |&gt; \n  filter(TeamFull == \"Nebraska Cornhuskers\")\nnuaway &lt;- big10away |&gt; \n  filter(TeamFull == \"Nebraska Cornhuskers\")\n  \nmenaway &lt;- menthrees |&gt; \n  group_by(Location, Year) |&gt; \n  filter(Location == \"Away\")\n\nmenhome &lt;- menthrees |&gt; \n  group_by(Location, Year) |&gt; \n  filter(Location == \"Home\") \n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=big10home, \n    aes(x=Average3PPct, y=Season), color=\"darkblue\", alpha=.3) +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=big10away, \n    aes(x=Average3PPct, y=Season), color=\"blue\", alpha=.3) +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=nuhome, \n    aes(x=Average3PPct, y=Season), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=nuaway, \n    aes(x=Average3PPct, y=Season), color=\"darkred\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=nuhome, \n    aes(x=Average3PPct, y=Season, label=TeamLocation)) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Nebraska's 3 Point shooting is just average \",\n    subtitle = \"Comparing the Huskers to the Big Ten, Nebraska is in the middle\",\n    x = \"Averages\",\n    y = \"Season\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | Nevaeh Stauffer\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(color = \"red\", size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 12, face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we know that Nebraska shoots better behind the arc with the home court advantage. But compared to the rest of the Big Ten, those percentages still aren’t great and are just about average. Now let’s see if Nebraska’s best home shooting percentages rank in the top 10 in the Big Ten over the past five seasons.\n\n\nCode\nbig10home |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  top_n(10, wt=Average3PPct) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Average3PPct)) |&gt;\n  select(TeamFull, Season, Average3PPct) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    TeamFull = \"Team\",\n    Average3PPct = \"Percentage\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Behind the arc isn't where the Huskers are most likely to dominate\",\n    subtitle = \"Nebraska's best 3 Point Percentage doesn't even rank in the Top 10\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Nevaeh Stauffer  |  **Source:** Sports Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n    fmt_percent(\n    columns = Average3PPct,\n    decimals = 1\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = Average3PPct,\n      rows = Average3PPct &gt; .398)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Behind the arc isn't where the Huskers are most likely to dominate\n    \n    \n      Nebraska's best 3 Point Percentage doesn't even rank in the Top 10\n    \n    \n      Team\n      Season\n      Percentage\n    \n  \n  \n    Michigan State Spartans\n2022-2023\n42.0%\n    Purdue Boilermakers\n2021-2022\n40.7%\n    Penn State Nittany Lions\n2022-2023\n40.4%\n    Wisconsin Badgers\n2020-2021\n40.3%\n    Ohio State Buckeyes\n2019-2020\n40.3%\n    Michigan Wolverines\n2020-2021\n40.0%\n    Purdue Boilermakers\n2018-2019\n39.5%\n    Iowa Hawkeyes\n2020-2021\n39.4%\n    Iowa Hawkeyes\n2022-2023\n39.3%\n    Michigan State Spartans\n2021-2022\n39.1%\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Nevaeh Stauffer  |  Source: Sports Reference\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nOver the course of the past 5 seasons, Nebraska’s best at home shooting percentage doesn’t even rank in the top 10.\nSo Nebraska has had some great individual shooters on their team but as a team, behind the three point line isn’t where you are gonna see them perform at their best abilities."
